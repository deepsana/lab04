//Question 1: How can we tell from just its header that setPrice is a method and not a constructor?
//public void setPrice(int cost)?
// Because setPrice is not an object

//## Is the `increase` method in the previous question a mutator? If so, how could you demonstrate this?
// - Yes, it causes a change in the variable so the score changes.


//## Write down exactly what will be printed by the following statement:
```
//System.out.println("My cat has green eyes.");
```
//- My cat has green eyes. will be printed by the given statement.

//## What do you think would be printed if you altered the fourth statement of `printTicket` so that `price` also has quotes around it, as follows?
```
//System.out.println("# " + "price" + " cents.");
```
//It will print out whatever is inside the parenthesis since it has quotes.

//## What would be printed here?
```
//System.out.println("# price cents.");
```
//The ""# price cents" will be printed here.

//## Could either of the previous two versions be used to show the price of tickets in different ticket machines? Explain your answer.
//- No, because it has a quotation mark and it will just print whatever is inside the quotation.
